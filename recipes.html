                            <p>The Bacon Long John or Maple Bacon Donut is thought to have come out as part of the bacon
                                mania that has swept the United States and Canada and described as the perfect “campfire
                                breakfast” on the go with its yummy bacon pieces and maple syrup-flavored glaze.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>According to website <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maple_bacon_donut">Wikiwand</a>
                                the popular history is that Dawn Brown, owner of The Swirls bakery in Omaha, Nebraska,
                                started the “maple bacon donut craze” with “the Elvis”:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p><blockquote>“The bakery's owner, Dawn Brown, said she wanted something shocking that people would
                                love or hate, and would talk about. She describes the concept as simple: "It's your
                                breakfast plate turned into one item that you put in your mouth." She reported: response
                                from her customers has been overwhelming, and she prepares five pounds of bacon daily.
                                "I know that most people are coming for the maple bacon donut a.k.a. 'The Elvis'."</blockquote></p>

                            <p>Other popular donut shops have added similar bacon maple donuts to their menu; such as <a

                                like to take it up a notch with the ones that have jalapenos added to the bacon and
                                maple topped donut.</p>

                          <p>Cruller, Danish, Sinker, Long John: All names for a delicious treat of fried dough that people have made with different toppings since around the 1700s. The big question is how should it be spelled: Donut or Doughnut?</p>
                          <br>
                          <p>The origin of the name according to Dictionary.com:</p>
                          <br>
                          <p><blockquote>“Doughnut, of course, is a compound of dough (which became simplified to do- in donut) and nut. But why nut?
                            There are a couple lines of thinking as to how the nut part of the word came to be. One is that nut, here, is likened to a small lump of dough. The other is related to literal nuts, and traces the sweets back to a woman named Elizabeth Gregory who made deep-fried dough with cinnamon and nutmeg and put hazelnuts or walnuts in the middle. The nuts filled the space where the dough wouldn’t cook all the way through—a solution before the middle was taken out of doughnuts entirely.”
                            </blockquote></p>
