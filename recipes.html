                            <p>The Bacon Long John or Maple Bacon Donut is thought to have come out as part of the bacon
                                mania that has swept the United States and Canada and described as the perfect “campfire
                                breakfast” on the go with its yummy bacon pieces and maple syrup-flavored glaze.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>According to website <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Maple_bacon_donut">Wikiwand</a>
                                the popular history is that Dawn Brown, owner of The Swirls bakery in Omaha, Nebraska,
                                started the “maple bacon donut craze” with “the Elvis”:</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>“The bakery's owner, Dawn Brown, said she wanted something shocking that people would
                                love or hate, and would talk about. She describes the concept as simple: "It's your
                                breakfast plate turned into one item that you put in your mouth." She reported: response
                                from her customers has been overwhelming, and she prepares five pounds of bacon daily.
                                "I know that most people are coming for the maple bacon donut a.k.a. 'The Elvis'."</p>

                            <p>Other popular donut shops have added similar bacon maple donuts to their menu; such as <a

                            <p>The ones I have had are called Maple Bacon Bars by <a
                                    href="https://www.casualfridaydonuts.com/">Casual Friday Donuts</a> here in Spokane,
                                WA, and they are one of my favorite donuts on their own but I have several friends that
                                like to take it up a notch with the ones that have jalapenos added to the bacon and
                                maple topped donut.</p>

                            I am convenient because I require little markup to use effectively. I am similar to what is
